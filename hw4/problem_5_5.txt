Difference between:

calc {
    A;
==>
    B;
==>
    C;
}

and

assert A ==> B ==> C;

'calc' blocks gives more intermediate steps for an easier verification process. 
With a calc block, we can reason that for A to imply C, B should also be satisfied. 
If an error occurs, it is easier to track exactly which "middle" step failed in the proof.
On the other hand, with an assert statement, the check is done in place by just checking the entire block together. 
This may need to be broken down into smaller parts later if an error occurs. 
They both will give same results/proof, but in terms of readability and 
having less chances for making mistakes 'calc' block would be better to use.
